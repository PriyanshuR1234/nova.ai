# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Understanding the "Limited Access" Error

If you're seeing a "Limited Access" error like the one in the screenshot, it means your Railway account is on the free tier which may only allow database deployments, not web services. This is a limitation of Railway's free tier policy.

## Solutions for the Limited Access Error

### Option 1: Upgrade to a Paid Plan

1. Log in to your Railway account
2. Go to the billing section
3. Choose a paid plan that suits your needs

### Option 2: Use the Railway Pro Trial

Railway sometimes offers a free trial of their Pro plan:

1. Check if a trial is available in your account settings
2. Activate the trial to deploy your web service

### Option 3: Use Alternative Deployment Platforms

If upgrading is not an option, consider these alternatives:

1. **Render**: Offers a free tier for web services
   - Visit [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Sign up for an account
   - Deploy your web service using their Python template

2. **Heroku**: Similar to Railway but with different free tier limitations
   - Visit [heroku.com](https://heroku.com)
   - Sign up for an account
   - Deploy using the Heroku CLI or GitHub integration

3. **PythonAnywhere**: Good for Python web applications
   - Visit [pythonanywhere.com](https://pythonanywhere.com)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Upload your code and configure a web app

4. **Google Cloud Run**: Serverless deployment option with free tier
   - Visit [cloud.google.com/run](https://cloud.google.com/run)
   - Sign up for Google Cloud (requires credit card but has free tier)
   - Deploy your containerized app

## Fixing undetected-chromedriver Issues

If you're experiencing issues with undetected-chromedriver:

1. Install the correct version that matches your Chrome browser:
   ```
   pip install undetected-chromedriver==3.5.5 --force-reinstall
   ```

2. Verify it works by running the test script:
   ```
   python test_chrome.py
   ```

3. If you still have issues, check your Chrome version and update the `version_main` parameter in `main.py` to match your Chrome version.

## Preparing Your Project for Deployment

Before deploying to any platform, ensure you have:

1. Updated `requirements.txt` with the correct dependencies
2. Set up environment variables (RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production)
3. Configured your app to run in headless mode
4. Added necessary configuration files (Procfile, runtime.txt, etc.)

## Testing Your App Locally

Before deploying, test your app locally to ensure it works:

1. Run the Flask app:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

2. Test the Flask app:
   ```
   python test_app.py
   ```

3. Test Chrome automation:
   ```
   python test_chrome.py
   ```

If all tests pass locally but deployment fails, the issue is likely with the deployment platform rather than your code.
